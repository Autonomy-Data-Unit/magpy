As first lockdown continued we became very anxious about the large number of cats that could not be neutered because vets were only carrying out emergency work, and even that on a very restricted scale. Soon we found ourselves coping with unsocialised kittens at an unprecedented rate which continued throughout the year. Trapping them and finding temporary holding space while waiting for vets to offer surgery slots was frustratingly laborious and made everything very difficult to organise. There was also a large increase in the number of cats coming into our care as a result of their owners' inability to look after them, either due to Covid related illness or loss of employment and income. We worked non-stop through all lockdowns and huge credit is due to our small but very dedicated team of volunteers who were determined to do as much rescue work as possible within the restrictions we faced. By taking great care when in contact with members of the public, we were still successful in finding new homes for a significant number of our cats. We also had major financial anxieties as all our usual summer events had to be cancelled and our shop closed for long periods. The impact of this devastating loss of income is likely to continue well into 2021 so we are very anxious about our ability to maintain our usual high level of activity.\",\n",
